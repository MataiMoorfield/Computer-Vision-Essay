# What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is the work of making sense out of visual, audio, or other data inputs for machines. So far with computer vision, we are able to recognise faces, read licence plates, find objects in a given image, summarise the content of a photo, and a lot more.

At first computer vision started quite manually, with researchers trying to come up with to detect certain patterns and images, but with the surge of deep learning, over the last decade, we now have models that can automatically learn these patterns just by looking at the examples.

> ‚ÄúComputer vision is a field of study which enables computers to replicate the human visual system. It‚Äôs a subset of¬†artificial intelligence¬†which collects information from digital images or videos and processes them to define the attributes. The entire process involves image acquiring, screening, analysing, identifying and extracting information. This extensive processing helps computers to understand any visual content and act on it accordingly.¬†You can also take up a¬†computer vision course¬†for free to understand the basics under Artificial intelligence domain.‚Äù (M.

Computer vision is a branch of computer science that powers machines to see, recognise, and process images. It is a multi-disciplinary field, and is a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 


# How does Computer Vision Work?

<aside>
üëÅÔ∏è Computer vision primarily uses pattern recognition techniques to self-train and understand data.

Computer vision algorithms are trained by using a lot of visual data. The model process these images and finds patterns. ‚ÄúFor example, If we send a million pictures of vegetable images to a model to train, it will analyse them and create an Engine (Computer Vision Model) based on patterns that are similar to all vegetables. As a result, Our Model will be able to accurately detect whether a particular image is a Vegetables every time we send it.‚Äù (Dharmaraj, Mar. 2022).

> ‚ÄùWhile machine learning algorithms were previously used for computer vision applications, now deep learning methods have evolved as a better solution for this domain. For instance, machine learning techniques require a humongous amount of data and active human monitoring in the initial phase monitoring to ensure that the results are as accurate as possible. Deep learning on the other hand, relies on neural networks, and uses examples for problem solving. It self-learns by using labeled data to recognise common patterns in the examples.‚Äù (M.

# Computer Vision Platforms

Some pre-trained models developed by companies are:

- **OpenCV**: OpenCV provides both pre-trained models for tasks like object detection, face recognition, and more, as well as the tools to train your own models.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow offers a wide range of pre-trained models for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. It also supports training your own models.
- **Keras**: Keras, which is now part of TensorFlow, supports using pre-trained models from TensorFlow's Model Zoo, along with the ability to build and train your own models.
- **MATLAB**: MATLAB offers pre-trained models for various tasks like image classification and object detection through its Deep Learning Toolbox.
- **CAFFE**: CAFFE includes a model zoo with pre-trained models for various deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision.
- **DeepFace**: DeepFace is a library built on top of Keras and TensorFlow, and it's designed for face recognition tasks. It may use pre-trained models or allow training new ones.
- **YOLO**: YOLO is an object detection algorithm that often comes with pre-trained models for real-time object detection.
- **GPUImage**: GPUImage is a library primarily used for GPU-accelerated image and video processing, and it provides tools to work with filters and effects.
**Not Necessarily Pre-trained:**

- **Viso Suite:** This appears to be a collection of tools for visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping), which generally involve real-time localisation and mapping of environments using camera sensors. While it may not always use pre-trained models, it relies on sensor data and algorithms.
- **SimpleCV:** SimpleCV is a library aimed at simplifying computer vision tasks but may not always come with pre-trained models. It's designed to be user-friendly and accessible.
- **CUDA:** CUDA is a parallel computing platform and API developed by NVIDIA, primarily used to accelerate computations on NVIDIA GPUs. While it's not a pre-trained model itself, it allows various libraries and frameworks to leverage GPU acceleration for faster computations.
